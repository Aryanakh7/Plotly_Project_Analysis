# Plotly_Project_Analysis

Analysis of the Project

The goal of this analysis is to complete and visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer and create a website representing the OTU IDs, Bacterial Cultures Found, and bacterial Cultures present per Sample. In order to achieve this, a horizontal Bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart are created.
