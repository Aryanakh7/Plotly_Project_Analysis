# Plotly_Project_Analysis

## Analysis of the Project

The goal of this analysis is to enable the visualisation of the bacterial data provided and to create a website representing the OTU IDs, and Bacterial Cultures present per Sample. A horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart are therefore created and incorporated into a website in order to represent the data obtained through visualisation.
